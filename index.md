### Featured Projects

**Retail Analytics (MySQL, Power BI, DAX)**
- The Adventure Works dataset analysis revealed that the most popular product categories are accessories, bikes, and clothing, generating a total of $23.6 million in revenue.
- Sales from online channels have shown a significant increase over the past year, with a 15% growth rate and a total of $5.8 million in revenue generated through this channel.
- The most profitable customer segments are from the Pacific region, generating a total of $6.2 million in revenue, followed by the South Atlantic and Mountain regions.
- A key finding from the analysis is that the company's marketing campaign focusing on discounting products has not been effective, as the revenue generated from discounted products only accounts for 7% of the total revenue. It may be more effective to focus on other marketing strategies to increase sales.

**Supply Chain Management (Power BI, DAX, Data Modelling)**
- The supply chain management process is crucial to the success of any organization that deals with the production and distribution of goods. This project aims to analyze and visualize the data from various tables related to orders, order status, products, customers, and shipment using Power BI
- Project Objective was to Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that can help in measuring the efficiency of the supply chain. Identify the problem areas and bottlenecks in the supply chain process and Provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve the supply chain process.
- The analysis approach involves connecting the data sources to Power BI, creating relationships between the tables, and designing the dashboard. The dashboard includes various charts, graphs, and tables that help in visualizing the data.
- Based on the insights generated from the analysis of the supply chain data, the following recommendations were made:
1.	Increase the number of orders processed per shipment to reduce the shipping costs.

**Substance Addiction (Power BI, DAX, Data Modelling)**
- The purpose of this data visualization project is to analyze and visualize the data of substance addiction by gender in order to identify trends and patterns that can be used to inform interventions and policies related to addiction. The data was obtained from a national survey of substance use in Canada and covers a wide range of substances, including alcohol, tobacco, and various drugs.
- Project objectives were to: 1.Analyze and visualize the prevalence and patterns of substance addiction by gender. 2.Identify any gender-based differences in addiction patterns and prevalence. 3.Identify any trends or patterns in the data that may be useful for informing interventions and policies related to addiction.
- â€¢	By analyzing and visualizing the data of substance addiction by gender, we can gain valuable insights into the prevalence and patterns of addiction, and identify any gender-based differences in addiction patterns and prevalence.

[Jupyter Notebook Link](https://github.com/AnushkaJayalath/portfolio/blob/master/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20Telecom%20customer%20Churn%20(1).ipynb)

- In the competitive realm of telecommunications, "churn," which signifies customers leaving for other providers, is a critical concern. This project delves into a customer churn database with the aim of comprehending the reasons and patterns underlying these departures.
- The analysis of the data will involve using statistical techniques to identify trends and patterns. The following steps will be taken:
1. Data Cleaning: The data will be cleaned to remove any duplicate or irrelevant data.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data and identify any outliers or anomalies.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis will be used to visualize the data and identify any patterns or trends
- Through the analysis we have found that Approximately 26.5% of clients churned and finding are as follows,
1.The prominence of the 'competitor' reason suggests that customers are likely leaving due to the allure of offerings from rival service providers.
2. Customers facing higher monthly charges, total charges, additional data charges, and total revenue are more inclined to churn. This suggests that financial considerations play a significant role in customer decisions to continue or discontinue their subscription.
3.The emergence of offer type E as a notable churn reason underscores the necessity for a comprehensive review of its appeal and alignment with customer expectations.
4.A majority of churn cases are observed among FiberOptic clients, indicating a crucial need to enhance the quality and competitiveness of this service.
5.Clients with either phone or internet services exhibit a heightened likelihood of churning, underscoring the importance of addressing service quality concerns to enhance customer retention.
